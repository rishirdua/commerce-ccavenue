Suggestions and patches are most welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n--------\r\nRishi Dua <http://github.com/rishirdua>\r\nVibhav Sinha <https://github.com/vibhavsinha>\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to use\r\n------------\r\n- Install the Commerce CCAvenue (Tested on 7.x-1.2) https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_ccavenue\r\n- Drop into your preferred modules directory\r\n- Enable the module from admin/build/modules\r\n- Goto admin/commerce/config/payment-methods and create a rule for CCAvenue\r\n- Edit Action and Configure the Working Key & Merchant ID. CCAvenue has replaced the working key with Access Code and Encryption Key. So enter Encryption Key in place of working key\r\n- Download ccavenue.module from github.com/rishirdua/commerce-ccavenue/ and replace #value in $form['access_code'] with your Access Code.\r\n- (Optional) Some fields are hard coded in the function ccavenue_redirect_form and should be changed if required. eg: language: EN, currency: INR, Phone number: 1234567890 etc.\r\n- Replace the ccavenue.module file with the one in sites/all/modules/commerce_ccavenue\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/rishirdua/commerce-ccavenue/\r\n- Source Code: github.com/rishirdua/commerce-ccavenue\r\n- Project page: http://rishirdua.github.io/commerce-ccavenue\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENCE:\r\n--------\r\nCommerce CCAvenue Payment Gateway Integration\r\nCopyright (C) 2014, Rishi Dua <rishirdua@gmail.com>, Vibhav Sinha <vsinha@webdweb.in>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
